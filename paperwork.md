A scan feature enables the app to process pictures taken to look like scanned documents. When scanning, use the green overlay guide to help you capture the entire image. When the scanner detects the document, it will automatically take a picture and process it. You can choose to upload the image or retake the picture. Remember that image quality is affected by lighting, camera angle and stability. Make sure the document details are readable before uploading.
